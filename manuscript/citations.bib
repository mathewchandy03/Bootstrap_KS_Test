 abstract={Kolmogorov’s goodness-of-fit measure, D&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; , for a sample CDF has consistently been set aside for methods such as the D&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; or D&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; of Smirnov, primarily, it seems, because of the difficulty of computing the distribution of D&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; . As far as we know, no easy way to compute that distribution has ever been provided in the 70+ years since Kolmogorov’s fundamental paper. We provide one here, a C procedure that provides Pr(D&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; &amp;lt; d) with 13-15 digit accuracy for n ranging from 2 to at least 16000. We assess the (rather slow) approach to limiting form, and because computing time can become excessive for probabilities&amp;gt;.999 with n’s of several thousand, we provide a quick approximation that gives accuracy to the 7th digit for such cases.},

 abstract = {This article offers a practical guide to goodness-of-fit tests using statistics based on the empirical distribution function (EDF). Five of the leading statistics are examined--those often labelled D, W2, V, U2, A2--and three important situations: where the hypothesized distribution F(x) is completely specified and where F(x) represents the normal or exponential distribution with one or more parameters to be estimated from the data. EDF statistics are easily calculated, and the tests require only one line of significance points for each situation. They are also shown to be competitive in terms of power.},
