# Bootstrap_KS_Test

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is a useful goodness-of-fit statistic. It can be used to see if a population follows a hypothesized distribution and has and can be applied to a variety of fields. It has been used to analyze the random distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation (NÃ¦ss, 2012). A common misuse of the KS test is when the hypothesized distribution has unspecified parameters. Babu and Rao (2004) approaches this scenario using basic non-parametric bootstrap. There is also the scenario where both the hypothesized distribution has unspecified parameters and additionally the data are serially dependent. Zeimbekakis (2022) demonstrates a remedy for this scenario using semiparametric bootstrap. This study aims to address this scenario with non-parametric block bootstrap.
