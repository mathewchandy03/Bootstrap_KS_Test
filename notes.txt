4/2 Notes
- Merge tables
- Merge sections
- Make sure digits are the same
- Go over references
- Identify gap in abstract
- For serially dependent data with no specified parameters, non-parametric
bootstrap bias correction does not exist yet
- We propose instead of demonstrate


3/26 Notes
- 3 decimal places
- email

3/19 Notes
- mention references were method was abused
- mention financial data in introduction
- in discussion, future study on comparing two serially dependent series
- polish up methods
- split methods into sections, standard semi parametric, and new development
- rephrase section 3 intro
- when null is true, the test rejects the null at the desired level
- generate series of length million, transform to gamma, look at sample
autocorrelation
- label as empirical quantile, and theoretical quantile

3/5 Notes
- SP100 and SP500 for 4 years include in the paper
- Try different locations in those cities
- Try precipitation data from Central Park
- Try snowfall

2/20 Notes
- Try no resid 
- Try annual maximums of daily precipitation 
- Annual maximum temperature 
- txx (highest day temperature)
- lowest day temperature
- highest night temperature
- lowest night temperature


2/13 Notes
- Try SP500 and SP100
- Try GEV

2/6 Notes
- expand range to 0.11 but keep tick at 0.1
- say that the correlation for 0.75 is already very high (write the number)
- try procedures from Anthony's paper, parametric and non-parametric
- show that if there really is dependence in the series, results will be different
- do same comparisons on microsoft data
- look at sp500 index, tseries package
- make function load from tseries then create a table
- move step five to the beginning (repeat steps for 1 to uppercase B)
- three digits for phi

1/30 Notes
- Mention phi in text
- The two distributions are very similar, and their first
two moments match. 
- Because they are hard to distinguish
- Test is performing conservatively
- Make sure ticks do not overlap
- Connect lines and overlay on same plot

9/27 Notes
- Make sure that method works under null hypothesis
- Add manuscript introduction, method with equations

10/4 Notes
- Follow Anthony's procedure with block bootstrap
- Review Babu and Rao
- May need large sample size

10/11 Notes
- Try larger sample size
- Try with dependent data
- Begin writing paper (review notes)
- Methods

10/18 Notes
- For different alphas, look at empirical level and nominal level
- Zoomed in plot or histograms
- Try 800
- Look at annual precipitation in Mansfield
- Financial time series data (Stock returns of Microsoft)
- Daily closing price
- tseries R package

10/25 Notes
- Confidence interval for rate of rejection
- Try n = 3200
- Test that it's from normal distribution (data is from t distribution with certain dfs)
- hist.quote
- Microsoft data has heavier tail than normal, so test that it is normal (which we expect to reject)

11/8 Notes
- https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt
- Test power

11/29 Notes
- Try smaller durations for microsoft
- log difference
- Try t
- Rerun simulation with more jobs
- Look if there is more data
- Try other locations for precipitation

1/23 Notes
- Just rejection rate (percentage) 3 digit
- Function of phi, facet by other parameters
- Try -0.8 and 0.8
- Fix summary
- Kendall's tau
- n = 100 to n = 800
- show that there is autocorrelation (try autocorrelation and autocorrelation of squares)
- fit arma model and look at residuals, try t fit on residuals
