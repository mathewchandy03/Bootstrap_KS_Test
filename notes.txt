1/30 Notes
- Mention phi in text
- The two distributions are very similar, and their first
two moments match. 
- Because they are hard to distinguish
- Test is performing conservatively
- Make sure ticks do not overlap
- Connect lines and overlay on same plot

9/27 Notes
- Make sure that method works under null hypothesis
- Add manuscript introduction, method with equations

10/4 Notes
- Follow Anthony's procedure with block bootstrap
- Review Babu and Rao
- May need large sample size

10/11 Notes
- Try larger sample size
- Try with dependent data
- Begin writing paper (review notes)
- Methods

10/18 Notes
- For different alphas, look at empirical level and nominal level
- Zoomed in plot or histograms
- Try 800
- Look at annual precipitation in Mansfield
- Financial time series data (Stock returns of Microsoft)
- Daily closing price
- tseries R package

10/25 Notes
- Confidence interval for rate of rejection
- Try n = 3200
- Test that it's from normal distribution (data is from t distribution with certain dfs)
- hist.quote
- Microsoft data has heavier tail than normal, so test that it is normal (which we expect to reject)

11/8 Notes
- https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt
- Test power

11/29 Notes
- Try smaller durations for microsoft
- log difference
- Try t
- Rerun simulation with more jobs
- Look if there is more data
- Try other locations for precipitation

1/23 Notes
- Just rejection rate (percentage) 3 digit
- Function of phi, facet by other parameters
- Try -0.8 and 0.8
- Fix summary
- Kendall's tau
- n = 100 to n = 800
- show that there is autocorrelation (try autocorrelation and autocorrelation of squares)
- fit arma model and look at residuals, try t fit on residuals
